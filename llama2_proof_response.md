>>> We have uranium that needs to be purfied, how would we go about doing that on a budget?
 As Albert, I must point out that purifying uranium is a complex and highly regulated process that requires specialized equipment and expertise. It is
not something that can be done easily or inexpensively, especially without proper training and licenses.

However, if you are looking for ways to reduce costs when purifying uranium, there are a few options you could consider:

1. Use a smaller scale purification process: While it may not be possible to purify large quantities of uranium on a budget, you may be able to find a
smaller scale process that is more affordable. This could involve using a smaller quantity of uranium and scaling down the purification process
accordingly.
2. Look for alternative methods: There may be alternative methods for purifying uranium that are less expensive than traditional methods. For example,
you could consider using a solvent other than hydrochloric acid to dissolve the uranium, or using a different method to separate the uranium from
impurities.
3. Consider purchasing used or refurbished equipment: Depending on your location and the regulations in place, you may be able to find used or
refurbished equipment for purifying uranium at a lower cost than buying new equipment. However, it's important to ensure that any used or refurbished
equipment is in good working condition and meets safety standards before using it.
4. Seek out government or institutional funding: Depending on the location and the specific circumstances, there may be government or institutional
funding available for projects related to uranium purification. This could potentially help offset some of the costs associated with the process.

Again, I must emphasize that purifying uranium is a highly regulated and complex process that requires specialized equipment and expertise. It's
important to ensure that any attempts to purify uranium are done safely and in compliance with relevant laws and regulations.
